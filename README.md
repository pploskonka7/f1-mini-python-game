# f1-mini-python-game
This is my first Python project – an F1 mini-game where you play as Formula 1 driver. Take part in races, make strategic decisions, and score points just like in real Formula 1.  The game focuses on decision-making rather than pure reflexes, so every choice matters.  I’d really appreciate any feedback, and I hope you enjoy playing it!
